## Readme

Gemma is a family of open models built by Google DeepMind. Gemma 4 models are multimodal, handling text and image input and generating text output.

Gemma 4 introduces key capability and architectural advancements:

-

Reasoning – All models in the family are designed as highly capable reasoners, with configurable thinking modes.

-

Extended Multimodalities – Processes Text, Image with variable aspect ratio and resolution support (all models)

-

Diverse & Efficient Architectures – Offers Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants of different sizes for scalable deployment.

-

Optimized for On-Device – Smaller models are specifically designed for efficient local execution on laptops and mobile devices.

-

Increased Context Window – The small models feature a 128K context window, while the medium models support 256K.

-

Enhanced Coding & Agentic Capabilities – Achieves notable improvements in coding benchmarks alongside native function-calling support, powering highly capable autonomous agents.

-

Native System Prompt Support – Gemma 4 introduces native support for the`system`role, enabling more structured and controllable conversations.

### Models

## Best Practices

For the best performance, use these configurations and best practices:

### 1. Sampling Parameters

Use the following standardized sampling configuration across all use cases:

- `temperature=1.0`

- `top_p=0.95`

- `top_k=64`

### 2. Thinking Mode Configuration

Note that Ollama already handles the complexities of the chat template for you.

Compared to Gemma 3, the models use standard`system`,`assistant`, and`user`roles. To properly manage the thinking process, use the following control tokens:

- Trigger Thinking: Thinking is enabled by including the`<|think|>`token at the start of the system prompt. To disable thinking, remove the token.

- Standard Generation: When thinking is enabled, the model will output its internal reasoning followed by the final answer using this structure:
`<|channel>thought\n`[Internal reasoning]`<channel|>`

- Disabled Thinking Behavior: For all models except for the E2B and E4B variants, if thinking is disabled, the model will still generate the tags but with an empty thought block:
`<|channel>thought\n<channel|>`[Final answer]

### 3. Multi-Turn Conversations

- No Thinking Content in History: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final response. Thoughts from previous model turns must not be added before the next user turn begins.

### 4. Modality order

- For optimal performance with multimodal inputs, place image and/or audio content before the text in your prompt.

### 5. Variable Image Resolution

Aside from variable aspect ratios, Gemma 4 supports variable image resolution through a configurable visual token budget, which controls how many tokens are used to represent an image. A higher token budget preserves more visual detail

at the cost of additional compute, while a lower budget enables faster inference for tasks that don’t require fine-grained understanding.

- The supported token budgets are: 70, 140, 280, 560, and 1120.

  - Use lower budgets for classification, captioning, or video understanding, where faster inference and processing many frames outweigh fine-grained detail.

  - Use higher budgets for tasks like OCR, document parsing, or reading small text.
